## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Oscar!

Welcome to my GitHub, where code meets creativity and imagination knows no bounds. I am a passionate software developer who believes in the power of technology to change the world for the better. With my skills and expertise, I strive to make a difference in people's lives by creating innovative solutions to real-world problems.

When I'm not writing code, you can find me exploring the taking photos, flying drones, writing articles on architecture and construction, playing guitar, or traveling. I am a firm believer in the importance of balance, and I strive to maintain a healthy work-life balance that allows me to pursue my passions and maintain my creativity.

So take a look around, explore my repositories, and feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just chat about technology and its limitless possibilities. Let's build something great together!
